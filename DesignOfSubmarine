Watching Tomb Raider few nights agoï¼Œ the scene where the boat sink.
Got stuck in my head.
So many Tragedy happen in the sea.
The design of the boat is sloppy and doesnt really consider the scenario where it sinky.
If money where invested in macro"the boat"'s ability to resurface after all the hard waves. ie auto inflated material like bloons on edges of the boat.
and its mandated that sailor have to wear tiny oxygen pack at all time in the form of neckless or hoodie.
in the case of crash, the clothing can improve a lot more.

to reduce manufacturing these types of cost, reduce cost for under water tourism. 

in fact i think this is useful because who know whats out side of this planet. 
a technology that didnt iron out many many many times still have flaws to fix and rooms for improvement.

of course, sea exploration is not to destory the ecosystem. rather to see the unknown
