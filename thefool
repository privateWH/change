The fundamental User Error.
1. I reverse my car everyday, and one day I scratch one.
2. I read cards everyday, and soledomly get the context wrong completely.
3. Possible errors. 
    (Line 1) Text for existing sale, and ID
    (Line 2) Adding new Book Sale. 
     Misinterpret the context in line 1 where Id is ignored and (associating Line 2 with contents from Text for existing sale).
4. Insert Content a to Text B in between Line 2 and Line 3, Its better to show Before Text, and After Text.

     
To undertand why is hard, because I don't know what really happen execept knowing is wrong afterward.
1. Not enough of sleep.
2. Try to improve the process of doing work, while doing work.
