What I will teach my kids instead,
Blank papers... Many of them, 
Draw on it... Do exercises, write as much as you want.
Throw them away... 

Keep doing it. until you can create with confident in anything with blink piece of paper.
I wrote poetry when I only know how it feels without proper wording.
I write proofs from imagination
I jump into unknown terran knowingly is going to be hard.
I believe in the dreams to be believed...
