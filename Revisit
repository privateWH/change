revisiting "The Last Lecture" by Randy Pausch.
1. Securcy. Innovation, Patents, Secure projects for a puropse.
2. Tell your daught only pay attention to what the guy do and not what the say to you.
3. Brick walls to stop others, show you really want to get in. (The more you do, there will be so much walls you going to hit, recently, I realize hard to get focus, and search only how olypmic athlets are doing, one thing I came across is "when others are stop, your odds of success continue to increase) tight this with your passion or life purpose, narrow focus become essential if you think about quiting.

What I will teach my kids instead,
Blank papers... Many of them, 
Draw on it... Do exercises, write as much as you want.
Throw them away... 

Keep doing it. until you can create with confident in anything with blink piece of paper.
I wrote poetry when I only know how it feels without proper wording.
I write proofs from imagination
I jump into unknown terran knowingly is going to be hard.
I believe in the dreams to be believed...
