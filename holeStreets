Looking at an article regarding Computing Chip that emulate human cognition.
It resurface one of the idea I had few years ago after having movie with Colleague at CBSi.

Consider a grids of tiny holes that runs underneath the high temperature city side walk. (or walls)
The layer of ceremic that looks like sponge. where water are periodically run through the ceremic side walk.
Water can spike just high enough to clean the surface of the side walk (horiziontally)
Or it can ran through vertically, where it stimulate circulation of air flow.
This way keeps the city clean and it reduce the heat. 
I think it will reassembles how nature works without those concrete blocks..
