Limitation research:

basic derivitives works well. for change in one variable.
However, cases such as

if (x<5 && x>0) change can't occur. doesn't work well in describing in calculus.
A stepwise modeling might needed.
 
 The use of this language is in the gap in which data might not exists; hence, gap in rate of change.
 
 
 Criteria of good development environment:
 1. Good data visualization, test data for prototyping.
 2. Add generator to language
 3. close to runtime envirionment.
 4. Quick turn around recover for testing.
 5. between op and dev changes.
