Bootstrap and ROI.

A choice between automation:

1. Sufficient data to back up the needs for implementing automated task.
2. Early prototype emphasizes on steps in depth where it should accomplishes the job.
3. A choice must be made between return in investment, where design greater than evidences gather, or vice versa.
      In the case of design (time or work) greater than evidences (gather), it means experimental added to dictats how things are done.
      In the case of evidences greater than design, it means inefficent in redudanted work. 

4. A risk must be assessted during conversion between 1 and 2. It basically comes down to
    1. The value generated in 2 is greater than the effort put forward?
    2. The opportunity cost should be analysised.
