So I got a cold. I was researching for face mask.
And then I got expose to various types of gloves. medical grades specifically.
And then my wife wants food handling grade glove. 

I wish there is a product for food grade but reusable. 
The food grade for example : https://www.amazon.com/UltraSource-Disposable-Gloves-Powder-Latex/dp/B01CIWKBYM/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527532208&sr=8-4-fkmr1&keywords=reusable+food+handling+glove+4.0mil

But for reusable they always aim for durability. but lack of feature similar to medical grade, where it emphasizes thickness.

The application for this product would just be for kitchen-prep, the number adds up 2*365*(% of days you work)*(what times you do context-switching in the kitchen)
Therefore, it would be nice to have reusable but give that sensitivity towards it.
