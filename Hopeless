There is time that I just want to say, be hopeless.

When people see hope in thing， when people see new things to jump into， when prosperity happening.
I tend to skip all such subject，not because iis not worth doing，rather there is sufficient people doing it already.

UP TO Now，one thing that I still feel hopeless is Chinese medicine， no matter how many times I WANT to learn or understand. I still cant cind a truth that I can believe. THERE is many says its a peusudo science. but in my heart，thats so many years of dream and hope，so many gendration of study . and if its wrong， maybe just not at the right level of abstraction.
Maybe it was some  pattdrn thats incomplete rather a bullet proof manipulation of being

The  second thing
